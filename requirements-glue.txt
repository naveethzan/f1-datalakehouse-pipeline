# F1 Data Pipeline - Glue Environment Requirements
# This file is used for AWS Glue jobs (ZERO external dependencies!)

# NO external dependencies needed!
# Glue jobs use hardcoded configuration and native Glue services

# Note: Glue 4.0 provides ALL dependencies we need:
# - pyspark, pyarrow, pandas, numpy (data processing)
# - boto3, botocore (AWS SDK)
# - urllib3 (HTTP client)
# - Iceberg support (native via Spark configurations)
# - All other AWS services

# Note: This file is for GLUE DEPLOYMENT only
# - MWAA environment uses requirements-mwaa.txt (requests + Airflow deps)
# - Local development uses requirements.txt (all deps)
# - NO Airflow dependencies to avoid google-re2 compilation failure
# - NO requests dependency (Glue jobs don't make API calls)
# - NO pyyaml dependency (Glue jobs use hardcoded config)
